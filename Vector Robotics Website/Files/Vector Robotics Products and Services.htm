    <p class="w3-justify"> Vector Robotics androids are developed in different series and models. The model number is usually composed of a two-letter series identifier and a three digit number (e.g., AP400 and AP700 are both AP-series models). The model number can optionally be spelled with a hyphen between the letters and digits, which doesn't affect the meaning (e.g., AP700 or AP-700). A few models deviate from the model name standard, having a differing amount of letters and digits. Most humanoid models have 00 as the last two digits of the model number. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> We have 3 base android models for our everyday customers: The Caretaker models or “CT” models, the Personal Assistance models also known as the “PA” models, and the Security models also known as the “SC” models. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Though the androids can be flexed into a different role, the efficiency of the android reduces if set to a role it was not designed for. For maximum efficiency and comfort, we recommend purchasing the right android model for the role you are going to use them in the most. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> The gender and facial features of our androids are fully customizable and are based on our buyer's preference. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> We also have a lot other models than the ones previously mentioned. For more information or assistance with purchasing an android, please contact us using this <a href="Vector Robotics Contact Us.htm" title="Contact Us page"  class="w3-hover-text-green">link</a>. Thank you once again for your interest in Vector Robotics and we hope to hear from you soon.</p>
